## Project Overview

TianshanOS is a **configuration-oriented rather than code-oriented** embedded operating system framework, developed based on ESP-IDF v5.5+, designed for rack management of NVIDIA Jetson AGX + DFRobot LattePanda Mu carrier boards.

### Core Features

- **Fully Modular** - 220+ C source files, 110+ header files, 18 independent components
- **Configuration-Oriented** - Define hardware pins and system behavior through JSON configuration files
- **Unified Configuration System** - SD card priority + NVS backup dual-write, supports hot-swap sync, Schema version migration
- **Automation Engine** - Data source collection, rule engine, action execution, variable system
- **OTA Upgrade** - HTTPS/SD card dual-channel firmware upgrade with automatic rollback protection
- **Cross-Platform Design** - Supports ESP32-S3 and ESP32-P4
- **Security First** - HTTPS/mTLS, SSH public key authentication, PKI certificate management, tiered permissions
- **Unified Interface** - CLI and WebUI share Core API with consistent behavior
- **Multi-Language Support** - Chinese and English interface support

## Development Environment

### Dependencies
- ESP-IDF v5.5.2+
- Python 3.10+
- CMake 3.16+

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thomas-hiddenpeak/TianshanOS.git
cd TianshanOS

# Set up ESP-IDF environment
. $HOME/esp/v5.5/esp-idf/export.sh

# Set target chip
idf.py set-target esp32s3

# Configure project (TianshanOS options are in the top-level menu)
idf.py menuconfig

# Build
idf.py build

# Flash and monitor
idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor
```

### VS Code Development

Using the ESP-IDF extension is recommended, which supports one-click build/flash/monitor, Menuconfig GUI, code completion and navigation.

For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICK_START.md).

### Automation Engine Features

- **Data Sources**: Timer, SSH command output, system metrics, GPIO, variables, HTTP
- **Triggers**: Threshold, regex matching, time expressions, change detection
- **Actions**: Variable setting, command execution, event publishing, logging
- **SSH Integration**: Supports continuous monitoring commands (e.g., `ping`), real-time variable updates

### Unified Configuration System Features

- **7 Configuration Modules**: Network, DHCP, WiFi, LED, Fan, Device, System
- **Dual-Write Sync Mechanism**: NVS + SD card simultaneous write ensures consistency
- **Hot-Swap Handling**: Mark as `pending_sync` during SD card removal, auto-sync on insertion
- **Priority Management**: Memory cache > SD card > NVS > Schema defaults
- **Sequence Number Mechanism**: No RTC required, uses monotonically increasing sequence numbers to determine configuration versions
- **Schema Migration**: Supports configuration format upgrades and backward compatibility
- **Explicit Persistence**: CLI modifications are temporary by default, use `--save` for explicit persistence

See [Development Progress](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md) for detailed status.
